## Backticks

Place inline code between backticks.

Use backticks to reference bits of code you're narrating, but not for labels or button text.

## Capitalization

### Titles and headings

Capitalize titles and headings according to the customer's style guide if they have one or match capitalization to their existing documentation.

At Ritza, we default to **sentence case** for titles and headings.

Some of our customers prefer **title case** for titles and headings. 

Title case uses an initial capital for the first word of the title and all nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Don't capitalize the first letter of articles (a, the), conjunctions (and, but), and short prepositions (on, for). Applying title case can be tricky because a word may have a different function depending on its context. For example, "to" is a preposition in "Migrating to Bryntum" but an infinitive marker (part of the verb) in "How To Log In".

To correctly capitalize titles and headings, use a tool like [Title Case Converter](https://titlecaseconverter.com).

### Company names

Some company names use irregular capitalization rules. We've compiled a list of common examples [here](./vocabulary/brandnames), but you should check the company website to confirm their preferred formatting if there's any doubt.

If the company website doesn't clear up how to capitalize their brand name, follow Wikipedia usage.

### Websites and web publications

Capitalize the names of websites and web publications. Don't italicize.

## Formatting

Avoid numbered lists.
