# Process

Writing as a discipline is creative, but that doesn't mean it doesn't benefit from structure and process.

With too little process and you get unreliable quality and quantity. With too much process you get bland, cookie-cutter type writing that is better done by AI.

Here we go into detail on different kinds of process, team stucture, briefs, and editing. Parts of it are very specific to the way we do things at Ritza, and you can find more about our exact processes in the [Ritza Handbook](https://ritza.co/handbook), but we focus more on the parts of our process that are universal, or at least potentially useful to others.
