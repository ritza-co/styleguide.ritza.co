# Ritza's Writing and Coding Course

Ritza runs a writing and coding course that is broken into two parallel streams.

* [Writing for Coders](./writing-for-coders.md) is for software engineers who want to improve their writing skills.
* [Coding for Writers](./coding-for-writers.md) is for writers who want to learn to code.

The courses are run at the same time and are tightly integrated to allow each group to learn from the expertise of the other group, while both groups also receive support from the Ritza team.

The courses run for four weeks, and are fully remote. We communicate mainly in the [Ritza Slack](https://ritza.co/slack.html) and have a weekly zoom call. The time commitment is around 15-20 hours / week.

There is a joining fee of $100, and some scholarship places are available.

Apply by following the relevant links to [Writing for Coders](./writing-for-coders.md) or [Coding for Writers](./coding-for-writers.md).
