# Writing for coders

![Writing for Coders](./img/writing-for-coders.png)

We're running a four-week, intensive technical writing course, specifically for people with a background in software engineering.

You'll need to dedicate 15-20 hours per week. The course is fully remote, and you can join from anywhere in the world, but most people will likely be in a UTC+1 or UTC+2 timezone.

If you're a software engineer, improving your writing skills will help you in many ways:

* You'll be able to communicate better with technical and non-technical colleagues and customers. Especially with the rise of remote working, being able to structure sentences and paragraphs well will make your life easier (and probably help your career advancement)
* It will open up other roles. While many software engineers don't need to write that much, product managers, engineering managers, VPs, and CTOs need to write a lot, and your writing skills will likely be assessed directly or indirectly if you aspire towards those roles.
* If you consult or freelance either in addition to your day job, or as your primary income source, writing blogs, guides, and other text-based resources is one of the best ways to win new clients.
* Writing technical books, blogs, or courses is a great way to make some side income.


## Details

The course will be run mainly in [our community Slack group](https://ritza.co/slack.html). You'll be working through chapters of the book [On Writing Well](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548) and sharing your technical experise with participants from the other half of the course ([Coding for Writers](./coding-for-writers.md)), while also getting feedback from the [Ritza team](https://ritza.co/team.html).

* We'll start on Monday, 4 July 2022 and run through Friday, 29 July 2022.
* There will be a weekly Zoom call, but otherwise all work and communication will be done asynchronously, via Slack.
* There is a joining fee of $100.
* For each person who pays the joining fee, we are making one scholarship place available for someone who cannot afford the fee.
* There will be a maximum of 12 participants (though likely fewer as this is the second ever time we are running the course).
