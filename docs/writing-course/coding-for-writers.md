# Coding for writers

We're running a four-week, intensive Python programming course, specifically for people with a background in writing.

You'll need to dedicate 15-20 hours per week. The course is fully remote, and you can join from anywhere in the world, but most people will likely be in a UTC+1 or UTC+2 timezone.

If you're a writer, learning some basic coding skills will help you in many ways:

* You'll be able to automate boring parts of your job (making the same edit across files, compiling statistics, web scraping, and more).
* You'll be able to write about technology and programming with more confidence (some of the highest paid writing gigs around).
* You'll have an easier time communicating with software engineers.

Some of the most in-demand jobs right now are a combination of coding and writing: product management, technical writing, developer advocacy, sales engineering, and more.

## Details

The course will be run mainly in [our community Slack group](https://ritza.co/slack.html). You'll be working through chapters of our book [Learn Python the Right Way](https://learnpythontherightway.com) and sharing your writing experise with participants from the other half of the course ([writing for coders](#)), while also getting feedback from the [Ritza team](https://ritza.co/team.html).

* We'll start on Monday, 4 July 2022 and run through Friday, 29 July 2022.
* There will be a weekly Zoom call, but otherwise all work and communication will be done asynchronously, via Slack.
* There is a joining fee of $100.
* For each person who pays the joining fee, we are making one scholarship place available for someone who cannot afford the fee.
* There will be a maximum of 12 participants (though likely fewer as this is the second ever time we are running the course).

    * You have some demonstrable writing experience.
    * You can commit to 15-20h/week.
