# Guidelines for taking good screenshots for technical documentation

## Resolution and file size

* Take screenshots on a machine with at least a 4k or Retina monitor
* Screenshots should not be larger than 200 KB, and preferably under 100 KB each

## Zooming and cropping

* Show a full window whenever possible - this keeps sizing consistent and helps the reader locate the correct portion of the UI to interact with

## Annotations and callouts

* Use red callouts unless the content of the screenshot contains too much red for the callout to be noticed 
* Generally use rectangles to call the readers attention to specific inputs or buttons
* If showing three or more separate steps in a single screenshot, add numbered callouts (1), (2), (3), etc to indicate the order steps should be taken in
* If interacting with a smaller part of the screen, add a red arrow to direct the reader's attention to the correct place in the screen

### Examples

* Do not leave space between a rectangle and what it is outlining

## Gifs and videos

* Gifs have problems regarding file size, but are the most portable and easiest to work with, as generally anywhere you can add an image you can also add a gif
* For long gifs, use mp4 or webm instead
* Generally avoid including sound in technical screenshots


## Combining screenshots with text

* Put the text first, followed by the screenshot
* Do not put two screenshots in a row without text between them

## Finishing touches

* Add a browser frame and background colour with a tool like BrowserFrame
* Optimize the filesize with a tool like TinyPNG
