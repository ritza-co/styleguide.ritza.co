# Goals and principles

Our goal is always to **teach**. This often means helping our readers understand complicated technology, either conceptually or by example. Give your reader the exact information they need and include opportunities for them to learn more.

To achieve our goal, our content is:

* **Clear.** Be sure you know what you’re writing about. Keep words and sentences as simple as possible.
* **Useful.** Does the content deliver on the promise your headline made? Have you provided all the information the reader will need?
* **Friendly.** Don’t underestimate or patronize your reader. Use informal language.
