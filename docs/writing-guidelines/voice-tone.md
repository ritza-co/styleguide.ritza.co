# Voice and tone

Voice and tone is not about what we say, but how we say it. We aim to be consistent, functional and clear. Here are some tips for how to achieve this:

## Point of view

Default to **first person plural** to include the reader in your “team”. This means you and the reader are doing something together:

✅ "Next, we'll install the widget factory to create widgets efficiently."

Sometimes it's more efficient to use the **second person imperative** and "instruct" the reader by telling them what needs to be done. This can be harsher but it's often less wordy, so use your judgement:

* ⚠️ "We can do this by using our package manager. We'll achieve this by typing `sudo apt-install widget-factory`"
* ✅ "We can do this by using our package manager. Type `sudo apt install widget-factory`"

When using the imperative, there's no need to say "Please" to the reader.

* ⚠️  Please type `sudo apt install widget-factory`
* ✅ Type `sudo apt install widget-factory`

It's ok to refer to the reader as 'you' in some cases, where the writer is clearly not involved, but in general, default to the 'we' voice wherever possible:

* ⚠️ "As you might remember from the [previous tutorial](#), widget factories create widgets. In this tutorial..."
* ✅ "In the previous tutorial, we saw how widget factories create widgets. In this tutorial..."

## Voice

Default to **active voice**. This isn’t a hard-and-fast rule. Active voice often makes it clearer who is doing what and sounds less stuffy. That said, sometimes passive is simply cleaner (often in cases where there isn't a specific subject) - use your judgement.

* ⚠️ The command will be run by the shell.
* ✅ Use the shell to run any commands.
