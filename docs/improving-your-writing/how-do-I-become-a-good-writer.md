# How do I get better at writing?

Writing is a skill, but it's often treated as an art. People feel like they should be naturally good at it, and are embarrased if they aren't.

The single best thing you can do to improve your writing is to do it. A lot of it. For many years.

One shortcut is to watch this three hour video [The Craft of Writing Effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM) by Larry McEnerney. I hate nearly all videos, and always prefer to read information instead. I never recommend videos. This is a great video and you should watch it.

Once you're done, read [On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction ](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548) by William Zinsser

## Writing a lot

The best way to write a lot is by doing it. Try [docs.new](https://docs.new) or other text editor of your choice. Aim for a million words, and then another million.
