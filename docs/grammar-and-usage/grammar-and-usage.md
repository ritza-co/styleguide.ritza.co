# Grammar

Our choice of which English to use depends on each client's preference and house style. In the absence of a specified preference, default to American English.

## Abbreviations, initialisms, and acronyms

Don't spell out common shortenings, like API or HTML.

Shortenings written in all caps take no points (API not A.P.I.) and are followed by a lowercase 's' in plurals (APIs not API's). Only use an apostrophe to indicate possession:

*  ✅ Check the API's documentation.

If there's a chance your reader won't be familiar with an acronym or initialism, spell it out the first time followed by the short version in brackets:

* ✅ Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)

Use the abbreviations "i.e.", "e.g.", and "etc." sparingly, but format them as written here if you do. If you're unsure of the proper use of these shortenings, try using their definitions in their place to see if your sentence makes sense:

* i.e. "that is"
* e.g. "for example"
* etc. "and other things"

## Code comments

When adding comments to your code, start with a capital letter and use conventional punctuation if the comment is a full sentence or multiple sentences.

* ✅ // This config enables response validation and dumping of found errors to the browser console. It's meant to be used as a helper during the development stage, so please set it to false for production systems.

Short phrases and incomplete sentences don't need to start with a capital letter or end with a period.

* ✅ // insert record

## Contractions

Use common contractions (we'll, let's, can't) to make your tone friendly and informal, but avoid less common contractions (d'ya know 'em?).

## File extensions

Use uppercase when referring to a file type, add a lowercase s without an apostrophe for plurals:

*  ✅ PNG
*  ✅ PDFs

In file names, extensions should be lowercase:

*  ✅ tictactoe.png

## Fractions and decimals

Spell out and hyphenate fractions: two-thirds (not 2/3 or two thirds).

Use decimal points when a number is not easily written out as a fraction: 1.273.

## Numbers

Spell out a number when it starts a sentence or if it's under ten, otherwise use numerals:

*  ✅ Nine elements make up the array.
*  ✅ The array has nine elements.
*  ✅ MetaMask will give you a 12-word secret recovery phrase.

Some common expressions work best with numbers spelled out:

*  ✅ Back to square one.
*  ✅ An all-in-one solution.

Ordinals should mostly be avoided, but spelled out when used:

*  ✅ Third-party
*  ✅ First impression

Numbers over three digits get commas:

*  ✅ 999
*  ✅ 1,000
*  ✅ 3,500,000

## Percent

Use the % symbol instead of spelling out "percent".

## Pronouns

Use they, their, and them in the singular if the subject's gender is unknown or irrelevant:

*  ✅ Send your collaborator the join link and they'll be redirected to the sign in page.

Never use the pronoun "one".

Refer to a company or product as "it" (not "they" or "them"):

* ✅ Replit is an online IDE. It has various collaborative features.

## URLs and websites

Avoid spelling out URLs, but when you need to, leave off `http://www.`.
