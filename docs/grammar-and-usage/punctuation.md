# Punctuation

Use punctuation sparingly. If you find you need to use more than one or two commas in a sentence, the sentence is likely too complicated. Try rewriting long, complex sentences as two or more shorter sentences.

## Apostrophes

Don't use an apostrophe to indicate plural forms.

Use an apostrophe to indicate missing letters (can't is a contraction of cannot) or possession (the user's password).

Possessive pronouns don't take an apostrophe: hers, his, its, ours, theirs, and yours.

Avoid using a possessive apostrophe with brand names and inanimate things:

* ❌ Speakeasy's SDK Generator.
* ✅ The Speakeasy SDK Generator.
* ❌ The applications's administrator.
* ✅ The administrator of the application.

## Commas

Use a serial comma in lists:

* ✅ We shouldn't store passwords, access keys, personal information, or anything else sensitive in publicly accessible files.

Use a comma to separate introductory words, phrases, or clauses from the main clause of a sentence. These include:

* Transitional phrases and words

    * ✅ However, to ensure data security, it's crucial that you now set up appropriate user permissions.

* Adverbial phrases and clauses
  
    * ✅ In reality, you'll want to create a random user at the beginning of each login test.

* Conditional phrases and clauses
  
    * ✅ Before you can write any tests, you need a test user profile to log in with.

Avoid comma splices:

A comma splice occurs when two independent clauses are joined with a comma:

* ❌ Download the files you need, unzip them on your computer.

A clause is independent if it can stand alone as a complete sentence.

Correct comma splices by rewriting the independent clauses as complete sentences:

* ✅ Download the files you need. Unzip them on your computer.

Alternatively, add a conjunction:

* ✅ Download the files you need **and** unzip them on your computer.

Comma splices can be corrected by replacing the comma with a semicolon, but this approach is not recommended for our content:

* ✅ Download the files you need; unzip them on your computer.

## Quotation marks

Use double quotation marks (`" "`):

* ✅ Most of the features we tested for Cognigy are labeled as "research preview" or "alpha".

Make sure your computer is set to use straight quotes (`" "` and `' '`) not smart quotes (`” ”` and `‘ ‘` - sometimes called "curly quotes").
