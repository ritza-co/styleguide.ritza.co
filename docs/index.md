# üìì Welcome

Welcome to the [Ritza](https://ritza.co) style guide.

Ritza is a technical publisher producing guides, documentation, tutorials, blog posts, ebooks, and more ‚Äî by software engineers for software engineers.

This is our opinionated style guide, developed to help you produce work that is valuable and easy to understand.

The Ritza style guide is free and open source. You're welcome to use it, share it, and adapt it to suit your needs.

While some of it is specific to what we do, we hope a majority of it is generally applicable. 

Especially take a look at the following pages.

- üìù [Ritza's Writing Rules](https://styleguide.ritza.co/ritza%27s-writing-rules/Style/)
- ‚úíÔ∏è  [Grammar](https://styleguide.ritza.co/grammar/grammar/)

The whole styleguide is fully free and open source under the MIT license. This means you can copy it from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ritza-co/styleguide.ritza.co) and adapt it to your own needs without asking permission from us (though we always appreciate a note if you find it useful).
